# Designing a Smart Contract Platform

There are many interesting and difficult problems to solve in designing a blockchain-based smart contract platform. Most of the available documentation about how these platforms work focusses on the specifics of a particular platform e.g. Ethereum / NEO / Stratis. This repository aims to accumulate important writings about smart contract platforms generally, to better inform developers should they want to learn more or even start working on a new approach themselves.

The information here is mostly low-level and technical, and where possible blockchain-agnostic. It is ideally detached from the best practices and development of particular smart contracts themselves.

# Contract State

By their nature smart contracts store information on-chain. This includes contract code and data saved during execution.
